\title{Train a Generalized Additive Model on Simulation Data}
\usage{
train_GAM(results)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A list containing simulation results with the following components:
- `loglik_estimation`: A list of log-likelihood values or `try-error` objects.
- `trees`: A list of data frames, each containing tree data.
- `param`: A list of named vectors containing the simulation parameters `mu`,
  `lambda`, `betaN`, and `betaP`.}
}
\value{
A `gam` object representing the fitted model.
}
\description{
This function fits a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to the provided simulation
results. It models the log-likelihood of simulation success (`loglik`) as a function
of the simulation parameters, using smooth terms for each parameter. Only simulations
that completed successfully are used for the model fitting.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'results' is your list of simulation results:
gam_model <- train_GAM(results)
summary(gam_model)
